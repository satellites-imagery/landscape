# The Satellite Landscape

This is an exploratory overview of current and upcoming sources of data, processing pipelines, and data products. It is aimed at helping non-experts explore and harness the unfolding revolution of Earth observation, with an emphasis on understanding current capabilities and project development considerations.

## Development environment
The development environment is the same for both parts and has the following dependencies:

- Node (v10) & Npm ([nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) usage is advised)
- Ruby (v2.3) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io/), preferably through something like [rvm](https://rvm.io/)

> The versions mentioned are the ones used during development. It could work with newer ones.

After these basic requirements are met, run the following commands in the website's folder:
```
$ npm install
```

### Getting started
The site resides in the `app` and it is structured as a jekyll site.

```
$ npm run serve
```
Compiles the sass files, javascript, and launches the server making the site available at `http://localhost:3000/`  
The system will watch files and execute tasks whenever one of them changes.  
The site will automatically refresh since it is bundled with livereload.

#### Jekyll settings
There are several config files for jekyll that are loaded according to the environment.
The production settings are in `_config.yml`. If overrides for local development are required they should be done in `_config-dev.yml`.

## Development with Docker
Since this project is very old it is simpler to have docker run it.   
This was a solution to circumvent problems from an old system.

```sh
docker compose up --build
```
The container will start in port 3000 and use the local directory to build the web-site.
