## Further Investments

The power of remote sensing is increasingly being realized in global development efforts, spurring significant investments in the domain. Historically, remote sensing data had often been prohibitively expensive outside of commercial and federal applications and carried with it technically demanding storage and processing requirements. As capture, processing pipelines, and storage and serving of sensor data becomes more efficient, not only are commercial imagery prices becoming more competitive, but existing open sensor data resources are more approachable for global development and humanitarian organizations. This new level of access has exposed the value of earth observation information for solving critical global problems and highlighted the need for increased access and data coverage within implementing organizations.
