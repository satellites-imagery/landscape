Having your specific application and use case in mind, it is then helpful to gather a basic understanding of the satellite imagery you will be using and how it has been collected. Satellite imagery is not a one size fits all applications, and there are a multitude of considerations that go into determining what imagery will best support your use case. There are hundreds of earth observation satellites circling the Earth collecting imagery that you could potentially use, but the imagery comes in different resolutions, different levels of processing, assorted costs, and varying licensing that dictates the usage of the imagery.
