Spatial resolution (also referred to as ground sample distance GSD) refers to the size of one pixel on the ground. For example, a spatial resolution of 15 meters means that one pixel on the image corresponds to a square of 15 by 15 meters on the ground. Finer resolution indicates a lower pixel size and means you can see more detail in the imagery.
