# Typical Serviced Image

---

A typical serviced satellite image (bought or downloaded) includes several processing steps. From the raw image (Level 0), data are calibrated into units of physical reflectance (called Level 1 processing), and the image is geolocated and ortho-rectified following an elevation model of the terrain or Ground Control Points (GCP) of a certain Accuracy, under a geodetic reference frame (e.g., Mercator). Over large areas, several captures may need to be stitched together. This product is usually referred to as Level 2 or similar. In many cases, the end user will only see the final image, either in a report or as an interactive map on the web, such as the maps in this report.

### Data Processing Levels

The following paragraph and table explore the different levels of data processing that are done specifically by NASA, but also apply to the industry at large. 

NASA's Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) data products are processed at various levels ranging from Level 0 to Level 4. Level 0 products are raw data at full instrument resolution. At higher levels, the data are converted into more useful parameters and formats. All EOS instruments must have Level 1 Standard Data Products (SDPs); most have SDPs at Level 2 and Level 3; and many have Level 4 SDPs. Some EOS Interdisciplinary Science Investigations also have generated Level 4 SDPs. Specifications for the set of SDPs to be generated are reviewed by the Earth Observing System Project Science Office (EOSPSO) and NASA Headquarters to ensure completeness and consistency in providing a comprehensive science data output for EOS. Standard data products are produced at NASA's Distributed Active Archive Centers (DAACs) or Science Investigator-led Processing Systems (SIPS).
