# Typical Serviced Image

---

A typical serviced satellite image (bought or downloaded) includes several processing steps. From the raw image (Level 0), data are calibrated into units of physical reflectance (called Level 1 processing), and the image is geolocated and ortho-rectified following an elevation model of the terrain or Ground Control Points (GCP) of a certain Accuracy, under a geodetic reference frame (e.g., Mercator). Over large areas, several captures may need to be stitched together. This product is usually referred to as Level 2 or similar. In many cases, the end user will only see the final image, either in a report or as an interactive map on the web, such as the maps in this report.
