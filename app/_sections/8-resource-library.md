### STAC Tools & resources
A range of tools help facilitate the use of the STAC spec – some of the most widely used are:<br>

- STAC Browser is a Vue-based browser for STAC catalogs.<br>
- STAC Server (previously known as sat-api) is a STAC compliant web API for searching and serving metadata for geospatial data. It is written in Javascript and backed by Elasticsearch<br>
- STAC Validator is a python utility to validate STAC json files against the STAC spec or against local STAC extensions.<br>
- PySTAC is a library for working with STAC catalogs in Python<br>
- EODAG is a CLI tool and a Python framework for searching, aggregating results and downloading EO data through a unified API regardless of the data provider. It can be run as STAC client or STAC API proxy server for non-STAC providers.
