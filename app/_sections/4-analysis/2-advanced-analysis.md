# Advanced Analysis

---

Advanced analytical techniques go beyond inter-band math and may classify data into predefined fuzzy or map-like categories using machine learning techniques, compare imagery taken at different times to detect change, compare imagery taken at different angles to estimate elevation, or combine multiple source datasets to exploit the best qualities of each. These techniques often result in data products like 3D terrain maps, forest density estimates, maps showing fire and burn scar extent, measurements of crop type and health, maps of land cover types, or maps showing the probability of certain minerals existing along a gradient. These techniques are most computationally intensive and require significant processing resources, but the increasing availability of elastic cloud computing has made them more practical for development organizations.

Elevation and Surface Modelling
Elevation and Surface models are constructed by calculating the offset in radar or image-based data acquired from different angles. 3D terrain models are used to measure landslide or flood risk. 3D urban models are used to measure and manage vertical growth of cities, and can be used to calculate sight lines, shadow, and the corresponding implications for solar power or urban gardening initiatives. 
The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and newer NASA ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are two commonly utilized datasets that provide near global elevation coverage. Most commonly Radar and now Lidar are used to collect elevation and surface data, but the ASTER GDEM was collected using sensors operating in the visible-near infrared spectrum.
