# Advanced Analysis

---

Advanced analytical techniques go beyond inter-band math and may classify data into predefined fuzzy or map-like categories using machine learning techniques, compare imagery taken at different times to detect change, compare imagery taken at different angles to estimate elevation, or combine multiple source datasets to exploit the best qualities of each. These techniques often result in data products like 3D terrain maps, forest density estimates, maps showing fire and burn scar extent, measurements of crop type and health, maps of land cover types, or maps showing the probability of certain minerals existing along a gradient. These techniques are most computationally intensive and require significant processing resources, but the increasing availability of elastic cloud computing has made them more practical for development organizations.
