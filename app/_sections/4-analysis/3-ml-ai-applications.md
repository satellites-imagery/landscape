# Machine Learning and AI Applications

---

Machine learning algorithms allow a system to learn and improve from data and experience without being specifically programmed, reducing the level of human intervention. This data-driven approach means valuable information about a natural phenomenon can be extracted from the data alone. Machine learning with satellite data can help to improve predictions about the behavior of environmental systems, improve the automation of data analysis, lead to a better management of resources and the discovery of new insights from complex data sets.  Applications include improved weather forecasting, disaster response, precision agriculture, forest management, population estimation, and urban mapping.

Wider implementation for remote sensing is limited by the availability of accessible, and representative datasets for training the machine learning algorithm. Specific challenges include: the availability of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) that requires expertise, time, and computational power to prepare; the demands on storage, transfer and processing of large data sets; and the demands on having an accurate and well-developed training data set.  Recent developments in cloud storage and ML/AI technologies have allowed for increasing innovation in this approach to analyzing satellite data. 

### Supervised vs. unsupervised Classification

A common type of remote sensing machine learning is image classification, which is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels within an image based on a specific set of rules, or classes. Classification is commonly used to identify various Earth features such as forests, agriculture and crop types, roads and settlements, water bodies and snow, and even various rock types, identifiable in the imagery due to their unique spectral signature. There are two types of image classification; supervised and unsupervised classification.
