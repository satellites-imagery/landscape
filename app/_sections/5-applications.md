Advances in capture, analysis, and distribution of satellite imagery can have profound impacts on the global development community. Different image resolutions, revisit times and the derivative products created with satellite data and additional datasets provide actionable insights for governments, city planners and implementing organizations. These data inform the historical trends in a city, assist in the monitoring of infrastructure projects, and lay the foundation for various global health interventions. Geospatial data form a cornerstone of numerous health interventions including the distribution of malaria bednets, planning for routine immunization programs and COVAX activities to ensure coverage at the local, regional, and national levels. While these data are used to plan a variety of interventions, they also aid in the monitoring of mission progress by administrators and donors/funders alike. 
Several specific examples of geospatial technology being applied to global development programs are provided below.
