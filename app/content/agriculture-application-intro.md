### Forest and Agriculture

Due to the massive size and limited accessibility of forests, satellites have long an indispensable tool for forest management. Satellite imagery derived forest maps measure increases in greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, detect illegal logging activities, evaluate the availability and use of wood as cooking fuel, and assess the environmental impact of infrastructure projects such as road construction.

In agriculture, satellite imagery measures agricultural production. Imagery shows crop type and area of coverage, estimate rainfall, measure the effectiveness of irrigation systems, and evaluate the risk of droughts and floods. Satellite data is used for everything from developing insurance products for small farmers and early warning systems to detect decreasing agricultural production.

High frequency multispectral imagery creates significant opportunities on Forest and Agriculture projects. Regular imaging of rural areas in developing countries will yield comparable data at regular intervals unlocking new types of analysis of forest change and trends in agricultural production. More immediate information on crop health is critical to enable warning systems of potential drops in production in food sectors. Automated change detection will be invaluable in monitoring huge swaths of forest and agricultural areas.
