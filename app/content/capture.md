## Sharper. Richer. Every Day.

Satellite platforms are getting better and cheaper to build and launch. New platforms have higher resolution, collect images with greater frequency and collect new types of data, allowing new insights.

## Typical image purchase.

A typical image ready for usage as a service (bought or downloaded) is several processing steps already applied. Band images are combined to produce a color image in calibrated flux units (called *Level 1* processing), and the image is geolocated and ortho-rectified following an elevation model of the terrain or Ground Control Points (GCP) with a certain Accuracy, under a geodetic reference frame (E.g. Mercator). For big areas, several captures need to be stitched together. This product is usually referred as *Level 2* or similar.
