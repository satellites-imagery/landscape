#### Mathematic spectral transformations

In addition to False Color composition, spectral bands can be combined mathematically to emphasize a particular set of characteristics. These techniques draw from all relevant bands, rather than the three band limits of false color analysis, to draw out very specific characteristics. These techniques involve greater processing of raw data in order to minimize band characteristics that are not relevant to a particular case and by selectively enhancing the signal in areas where complementary band characteristics align. While false color can be used to identify agricultural fields, mathematic transformations can detect the health of each field. While false color can distinguish mud from water, mathematic transformations can tell you how wet the mud is.
