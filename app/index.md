Recent innovations and large-scale investments in satellite technology are heralding a new era of earth observation, with multiple terabytes of new data being captured, analyzed and distributed every day. Very high-resolution satellites are being complemented with thermal sensors, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, and satellite fleets that can monitor the globe every day, revisiting high priority regions multiple times throughout the day. Beyond the satellites themselves, the proliferation of machine learning, computer vision and cloud computing are greatly accelerating our ability to use satellite data for more informed decision making. The insights and outcomes enabled through space-based remote sensing are directly benefiting the global development community through more accurate understandings of where people live, in what density, and their relationship to our global ecosystems via land management, agriculture and climate change.  

This site offers an exploratory overview of current and upcoming sources of data, processing pipelines, and data products. It is aimed at helping non-experts explore and harness the unfolding revolution of Earth observation, with an emphasis on understanding current capabilities and project development considerations through both commercial and open-source channels.
